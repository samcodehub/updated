                    <p class="mt-4">Here are some of the basic commands in <strong>Pygame</strong> that you can use to get started with game development:</p>
                    <ol class="mt-4">
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Initializing Pygame</strong>: To start using Pygame, you need to initialize it using the <mark><strong>pygame.init()</strong></mark> command. This should be the first line of code in your game.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3 word-break"><strong>Creating a window</strong>: To display your game, you'll need to create a window using the <mark class="text-break"><strong>pygame.display.set_mode()</strong></mark> command. This command creates a window with the specified size and color depth.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Loading images</strong>: You can load images in Pygame using the <mark><strong>pygame.image.load()</strong></mark> command. This command returns a Pygame surface that can be used to display images on the screen.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Drawing on the screen</strong>: To draw images on the screen, you can use the <mark><strong>blit</strong></mark> method of the Pygame surface. This method takes two arguments: the surface to be drawn and the position on the screen where it should be drawn.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Updating the screen</strong>: After drawing on the screen, you need to update the display using the <mark class="text-break"><strong>pygame.display.update()</strong></mark> command. This command redraws the entire screen, making your changes visible to the player.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Handling user input</strong>: You can handle user input in Pygame using the <mark><strong>pygame.event.get()</strong></mark> command. This command returns a list of events that have occurred, such as mouse clicks or key presses.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Playing sound</strong>: You can play sounds in Pygame using the <mark><strong >pygame.mixer</strong></mark> module. This module provides commands for loading and playing sounds, as well as controlling the volume and playback speed.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="mt-4">These are just a few of the basic commands in <strong>Pygame</strong>. With these commands, you can create simple games, such as Pong or Snake, and build from there to create more complex games.</p>

                    <p class="mt-4">Here are some of the advanced commands in <strong>Pygame</strong> that you can use to create more complex games:</p>

                    <ol class="mt-4">
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Sprites</strong>: Pygame provides a sprite module that makes it easier to work with multiple objects on the screen. Sprites allow you to group together images and related behavior, making it easier to manage and control the objects in your game.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Collision detection</strong>: You can use the Pygame sprite module to detect collisions between objects in your game. This is useful for games that require objects to interact with each other, such as in platformers or puzzle games.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Animation</strong>: Pygame provides commands for animating images, such as moving them across the screen or changing their appearance over time. You can use these commands to create animations for your game, such as character movements or particle effects.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>User interface elements</strong>: Pygame provides commands for creating user interface elements, such as buttons, sliders, and text fields. These elements can be used to create menus, dialogs, and other interface elements for your game.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>Advanced sound effects</strong>: The Pygame mixer module provides commands for creating advanced sound effects, such as equalization and reverb. You can use these commands to create more immersive soundscapes for your game.</li>

You can use these commands to create games that allow players to interact with each other in real-time, such as online multiplayer shooters or strategy games.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="mt-4">These are just a few of the advanced commands in <strong>Pygame</strong>. With these commands, you can create more complex games that include advanced graphics, sound, and user interface elements, as well as networked multiplayer support.</p>

                    <p class="mt-4">Here is a simple example code that creates a <strong>Pygame</strong> window and displays a blue screen:</p>
<div id="code-container"class="bg-dark text-white pt-3 ps-3 pe-3">
<pre>
<code class="language-Python">import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()
  
# Set the screen size
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 300))
  
# Set the screen color to blue
screen.fill((0, 0, 255))
  
# Update the screen to display the changes
pygame.display.update()
  
# Run the game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
  
# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()

</div>
                    
                        <p class="mt-4">This code creates a <strong>Pygame</strong> window with a size of 400x300 pixels and sets the background color to blue. The game loop runs until the player closes the window, at which point the code quits <strong>Pygame</strong>. This is a simple example to get you started with Pygame, and you can build from here to create more complex games.</p>
